These skills will help managers to understand and carry out data-based decision making, risk assessments, and policy making and to work effectively with data analysis teams to improve all aspects of business performance.\nModern data analysis is done using computers and various types of sophisticated software. Therefore, to most effectively introduce management candidates to its techniques, we will also emphasize software applications (with Microsoft Excel, R, or Python) in this course.\n\nCourse Materials\nThe following are learning materials:\n\nText book: Anderson, Sweeney, Williams, Camn, Cochran, Fry, and Ohlmann: Modern Business Statistics with Microsoft Excel, 7th edition, 2018, Cengage Learning, Inc. (Required) This text is also used in STAT 30301.\nHandouts: Lecture Slides and Supplementary Materials.

Participants are typically randomly assigned to groups (e.g., treatment vs. control), and outcomes are compared to determine causal relationships. This design provides strong evidence for cause-and-effect due to the controlled environment and random assignment.\n\n\nThe largest experimental study ever conducted is believed to be the 1954 Public Health Service experiment for the Salk polio vaccine. Nearly two million U.S. children (grades 1 through 3) were selected."

Per the School of Business Undergraduate Grading Policy, the target grade distribution for elective courses culminates in an average GPA of 3.3. To comply with this policy, the final course letter grades will be based on the curved class final course percentages. The final course percentage is based on a weighted percentage computed using the weights shown in the table below:\n\n\n\nAssignment\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nAttendance\n7%\n\n\nQuizzes.\n18%\n\n\nExercises\n25%\n\n\nProject\n25%\n\n\nVirtual Final Exam\n25%\n\n\n\n\n\nAttendance\nAttend your classes, pay attention and participate. If you do not attend class, you will likely not succeed. According to the University regulations, “Scheduled courses allow students to avoid conflicts and reflect the University’s expectation that students should be present for every meeting of a class/laboratory for which they are registered.” The instructor will take random attendance and keep the attendance record. Your attendance grade will be based on this record.\n\n\nQuizzes\nIndividual timely completion of pre-class readings will be covered by quizzes questions to be submitted before each class (starting before the second class).\n\n\nExercises\nIndividual post-class exercises demonstrating your engagement with the course content (starting after the first class).\n\n\nProject\nIn initially random assigned groups (up to 6 members and no less than 5 members), students must submit a team’s project report presentation on Brightspace, showcasing a practical application of the learned concepts. A guideline document will be shared by the instructor after before lesson 10.\n\n\nVirtual Final Exam\nA one and a half hours of online final exam hosted on Brightspace to assess your overall understanding of the course material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPlease note that: - The final exam will be conducted individually, online and is open book. - It will take place on the date assigned in the schedule. You must start your exam between the starting time and ending times. At or after the ending time, the exam will not be available for starting. - The duration of the exam is one hour. Once you begin the exam, it must be completed within 1.5 hours. - The exam will conclude at the end of your 90 minutes by an automatic submission. - It is your responsibility to ensure you have a functional computer, a reliable network connection, and follow exam schedule. - During the exam time I will be available in the Office Hours link to answer any content-related questions you may have.",
